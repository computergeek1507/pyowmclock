# PyOWMClock

This project is for a building a digital clock that includes temperature display. It uses OpenWeatherMap to retrieve outside temperature information and a MCP9808 sensor for inside temperature. The assembly is fairly simple and requires the following components:

* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
* [Adafruit 1.2" 4-Digit 7-Segment Display w/I2C Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1270)
* [MCP9808 Temperature Sensor Breakout Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1782)

## Software

This guide assumes the Raspberry Pi is already setup with a working internet connection. First, make sure all the common dependencies have been installed:

```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git build-essential python-dev python-smbus python-imaging python-pip python-pil
```

### Time Configuration

For the clock to be accurate the local time of the Raspberry Pi will need to be correct. First make sure the time zone is set correctly:

```bash
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

Then  make sure the time is being updated correctly by installing `ntpd`:

```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ntp
```

The default NTP configuration should be good enough, but can be modified to specify the time server by editing `/etc/ntp.conf`.

### OpenWeatherMap

PyOWMClock uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) to retreive temperature data for our clock. An OWM API key will be required, but the free tier is sufficient.

The `pyowmclock.py` script uses the excellent OWM wrapper library, [PyOWM](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm) and can be installed using `pip`.

```bash
$ pip install pyowm
```

### PyOWMClock

If you haven't already, clone the pyowmclock project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fraugware/pyowmclock
```

The `pyowmclock.py` script takes several command-line arguments, use `-h` to show the usage:

```bash
$ python pyowmclock.py -h
usage: pyowmclock.py [-h] --api_key API_KEY --zip_code ZIP_CODE
                     [--use_f [USE_F]] [--display [DISPLAY]]
                     [--weather [WEATHER]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --api_key API_KEY    OpenWeatherMap API Key
  --zip_code ZIP_CODE  ZIP Code for weather lookup
  --use_f [USE_F]      Use Fahrenheit instead of Celsius for temperature
                       display
  --display [DISPLAY]  Interval in seconds between display changes
  --weather [WEATHER]  Interval in seconds between weather updates
```

The `--api_key` and `--zip-code` arguments are required, but the others are optional. By default the script will display temperature in Celsius, so use `--use_f 1` for Fahrenheit. The `--display` option is the time in seconds between flipping between time and temperature display; the default is **5** seconds. The `--weather` option is the time between temperature updates from both OWM and the temperature sensor; the default is **300** seconds (5 minutes).

**Example:**

Using the default display and weather intervals but Fahrenheit display for us here in the US:

```bash
$ python pyowmclock.py --api_key b73bacafe2494a70434ddd57a73a3d80 --zip_code 12345 --use_f 1
```

### Running as a Service

Running the script manually each time isn't too much fun so I've included a service file that can be used to have it start up automatically on boot. The service file assumes the `pyowmclock.py` script is in `/home/pi/pyowmclock/`, so if this is not the case you will need to adjust the paths in the service file.

The service file uses an environment file to pass in command-line options to the script; this allows changing the options without having to modify and reinstall the service. An example environment file is included, so you can just copy and modify to meet your needs:

```bash
$ cp pyowmclock.env.example pyowmclock.env
$ nano pyowmclock.env
```

You can use the following steps to install the service:

```bash
$ sudo cp pyowmclock.service /lib/systemd/system/
$ sudo systemctl enable pyowmclock.service
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/pyowmclock.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/pyowmclock.service.
$ sudo systemctl start pyowmclock.service
```

You can then verify that it has started correctly using `journalctl`:

```bash
$ sudo journalctl -u pyowmclock.service

## Hardware

Hardware configuration is pretty simple. Both the MCP9808 and the LED Backpack use I<sup>2</sup>C, so make sure it has been enabled using `raspi-config` if it hasn't been already.

The larger 1.2" LED Backpack requires 5 V, so the 5 V pin on the Pi needs to be wired to the `+` pin ont he LED Backpack. Since the Pi GPIO voltage is 3.3 V, a 3.3 V pin needs to be wired to the IO pin on the LED Backpack.
